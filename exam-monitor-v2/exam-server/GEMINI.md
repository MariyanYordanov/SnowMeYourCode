# Gemini CLI - Exam Monitor v2.0 Project Analysis and Plan

## Date of Analysis: 4 юли 2025 г.

## Project Overview:
This project is a JavaScript-based exam monitoring system with an anti-cheat mechanism designed to enforce fullscreen mode. The anti-cheat system is intended to detect any attempt to leave focus and terminate the exam without the possibility of re-entry.

## Identified Problems:

### 1. Client-side Exam Termination:
- **Issue:** When `anticheat.js` detects a violation (fullscreen exit or window hidden), it sends a `suspicious-activity` event to the server, but the *exam termination itself occurs on the client-side* via `terminateExamDirectly`.
- **Risk:** Client-side code can be easily manipulated, and `window.close()` can be blocked by browsers, making the anti-cheat ineffective.

### 2. Lack of Server-side Forced Termination on Violation:
- **Issue:** `WebSocketHandler.mjs` receives suspicious activity events and logs them, but *does not initiate a forced exam termination* on the server-side based on these events. `forceDisconnectStudent` is currently only used for exam time expiration.
- **Impact:** This creates a critical vulnerability where a student can bypass the anti-cheat by manipulating client-side code.

### 3. Global `window.ExamApp` Object:
- **Issue:** Reliance on a global object for application state (`window.ExamApp`) can lead to maintainability issues, naming conflicts, and makes the code harder to test and reason about.

### 4. Hardcoded Values:
- **Issue:** Exam duration and grace period are hardcoded in `SessionManager.mjs`, making configuration less flexible.

### 5. `emergencyResetViolations` Function:
- **Issue:** The presence of `emergencyResetViolations` in `anticheat.js` suggests a potential backdoor or debugging function.
- **Risk:** If not properly secured or removed, this could be a security vulnerability.

## Proposed Action Plan:

To address the identified issues and enhance the robustness of the anti-cheat system, the following steps will be taken:

### 1. Centralize Forced Exam Termination on the Server:
- **Action:** Modify `WebSocketHandler.mjs` to initiate a forced exam termination for the corresponding student when a `suspicious-activity` event is received from the client. This will leverage `forceDisconnectStudent` to ensure server-side control over exam termination.
- **Rationale:** This is the most critical step to prevent client-side bypasses and ensure the integrity of the anti-cheat system.

### 2. Improve Client-Server Communication for Violations:
- **Action:** Ensure that the client sends sufficiently detailed information about the violation (e.g., type of violation, timestamp, additional context) to the server.
- **Rationale:** This will allow the server to make more informed decisions regarding exam termination and logging.

### 3. Enhance Client-side `terminateExamDirectly` (Fallback):
- **Action:** If `window.close()` fails (e.g., due to browser restrictions), the client should be redirected to a dedicated page clearly indicating that the exam has been terminated due to a violation.
- **Rationale:** Provides a more robust user experience and prevents students from continuing the exam in an invalid state if the window cannot be closed.

### 4. Review `emergencyResetViolations`:
- **Action:** Evaluate the necessity of `emergencyResetViolations`. If it's a debugging or administrative function, ensure it's properly secured (e.g., only accessible to authenticated teachers) or removed if not intended for production use.
- **Rationale:** Mitigates potential security risks.

### 5. General Code Quality and Consistency Improvements:
- **Action:** Address minor inconsistencies, improve error logging, and refactor code where necessary to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Rationale:** Improves overall code health and makes future development easier.

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. Centralized Forced Exam Termination on the Server:
- Modified `modules/WebSocketHandler.mjs` to call `this.sessionManager.completeSession` with `'forced_violations'` and `this.forceDisconnectStudent` with `'suspicious_activity'` when a `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY` event is received from the client.

### 2. Improved Client-Server Communication for Violations & Enhanced Client-side `terminateExamDirectly` (Fallback):
- Modified `public/student/js/anticheat.js`:
    - Changed `terminateExamDirectly` to be a no-op on the client-side, logging a warning instead of attempting to close the window or exit the exam directly.
    - Removed direct calls to `terminateExamDirectly` from `handleFullscreenViolation` and `handleVisibilityChange`.
- Modified `public/student/js/socket.js`:
    - Imported `showViolationExitDialog` from `dialogs.js`.
    - Updated `handleForceDisconnect` to use `showViolationExitDialog` to display a message to the student and then call `window.exitExam`.

### 3. Removed `emergencyResetViolations`:
- The `emergencyResetViolations` function was removed from `public/student/js/anticheat.js`.

### 4. Hardcoded Values (Configuration):
- Modified `modules/SessionManager.mjs` to read `exam.duration` and `security.sessionSecurity.gracePeriod` from `config/exam-config.json`.

### 5. General Code Quality and Consistency Improvements (Minimizing `window.ExamApp` usage):
- Refactored the following files to minimize direct references to the global `window.ExamApp` object by introducing local `examApp` variables within functions:
    - `public/student/js/login.js`:
        - Modified `setupLoginForm`, `handleLogin`, `handleLoginSuccess`, `handleLoginError`, `handleSessionRestore`, `resetLoginState`, `getLoginState`, `getTermsAcceptanceInfo` to accept `examApp` as an argument.
        - Updated event listeners in `setupLoginForm` to pass `examApp` to `handleLogin`.
        - Modified `handleLogin` to pass `examApp` to `handleLoginSuccess` and `handleLoginError`.
    - `public/student/js/main.js`:
        - Updated calls to `setupLoginForm()` and `setupSocket()` to `setupLoginForm(examApp)` and `setupSocket(examApp)`.
        - Adjusted assignments to `window.handleLogin`, `window.handleLoginSuccess`, `window.handleSessionRestore`, `window.handleLoginError` in `setupWindowFunctions` to correctly pass `examApp` to the imported functions.
        - Added `resetLoginState`, `getLoginState`, `getTermsAcceptanceInfo` to `examApp` in `setupWindowFunctions`.
    - `public/student/js/timer.js`
    - `public/student/js/anticheat.js`
    - `public/student/js/socket.js`
    - `public/student/js/editor.js`

### 6. Addressed `iframe` Sandbox Warning:
- Modified `public/student/index.html` to expand the `sandbox` attribute of the `<iframe>` element to `allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-downloads allow-modals` to resolve the console warning and ensure necessary functionality while maintaining security.

These changes significantly enhance the security and maintainability of the anti-cheat system by centralizing control on the server-side and improving code consistency.
